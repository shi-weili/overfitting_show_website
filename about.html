                <p>Edward Mendelson has noted in his article In The Depths of Digital Age that, "Every technological revolution coincides with changes in what it means to be a human being, in the kinds of psychological borders that divide the inner life from the world outside."</p>

                <p>OVERFITTING aims to play with the "borders" between the outside and the inside through the lens of technologies. In this exhibition, viewers are invited to see, to touch, to perform with the artworks, which have incorporated “trendy technologies” into the concepts of them. Unlike our daily life, however, viewers are unsustained and unburdened by the technologies in the artworks. Instead, with the help of technologies, viewers will be introduced to unexpected perspectives of mundane life, thus experiencing a moment of awareness and reflection.</p>

                <p>In the field of machine learning, overfitting occurs when a computer model is excessively complex and given to many parameters. The computer fails to identify signals, instead it reacts to too much information including distraction and noises.</p>

                <p>Ironically, although overfitting is considered a technical problem when a computer is trained to think and predict as a human brain does, it vividly mimics our brains in the so-called Digital Age. We are flooded by information provided by new technologies (smartphones and social medias) even before having time distinguishing the necessary from the distraction.</p>
